# Logo Asset

## Required File
Place the red apple CARB logo as `logo-red.png` in this directory.

## Specifications
- **Format**: PNG (with transparency recommended)
- **Color**: Red (#d32f2f or similar)
- **Minimum Size**: 512x512px for PWA support
- **Recommended**: Square aspect ratio

## Temporary Placeholder
Until you add the actual logo file, the app will show a broken image icon. You can:

1. Add your official CARB red apple logo as `logo-red.png`
2. Use a placeholder by creating a simple red square/circle
3. Download a placeholder from: https://via.placeholder.com/512x512/d32f2f/ffffff?text=CARB

## Quick Placeholder Command
If you need a temporary placeholder while developing:

```bash
# This will create a simple SVG placeholder
cat > logo-red.png << 'EOF'
<!-- Placeholder - Replace with actual logo -->
EOF
```

For the actual red apple CARB logo, contact your design team or CARB brand assets department.
